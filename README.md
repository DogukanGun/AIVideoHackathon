# NexArb - Decentralized Real Estate Market

**NexArb** is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. By utilizing NFTs and advanced machine learning models, NexArb ensures transparent and secure ownership transfers.

## Features

- **Asset Tokenization**: Real estate assets are represented as NFTs on the Zora chain.
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Each asset's NFT guarantees transparency and security in ownership transfer.
- **Sales Agreement Verification**: Sales agreements are securely stored via Lighthouse and verified by AI models.
- **Lightweight Llama Models**: Efficient machine learning models verify transactions, ensuring accuracy and minimizing hallucinations.
- **Seamless Integration**: Smart contracts are deployed on the Zora chain, ensuring decentralized asset management.

## Architecture

1. **Selling an Asset**: When a real estate asset is listed, it is tokenized into an NFT on the Zora chain. The sales agreement is uploaded to decentralized storage (Lighthouse).
2. **Buying an Asset**: Buyers purchase the tokenized asset via blockchain transactions.
3. **Verification**: A verifier, powered by Llama models, checks the validity of the transaction based on the sales agreement.

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced LLM verification module
- Improved encryption for sales agreements
- UI/UX enhancements for a better user experience
